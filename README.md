# votemk

> This project is similar to the one in https://github.com/mkox/Mk.Vote-flow.
Instead of PHP now JavaScript is at its center, using vue.js (https://vuejs.org/), started with vue-cli + webpack.
At the moment only one table with some basic data is shown in the frontend, but much more data is already calculated in the background
(and e.g. can be seen in a browser console).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
